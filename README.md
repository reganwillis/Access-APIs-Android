# Access-APIs-Android

The code in this repository shows a clean way to access APIs in Android Java development. It has three classes:

* MainActivity -- generated by Android and runs the other two classes
* HTTPSRequest -- makes a GET request to get information from an API
* IOHandler -- writes an input stream to a file and reads the file

# Installation

To use this code in your application, HTTPSRequest and IOHandler can be brought straight into your project and do not need any editing. The MainActivity class has the function queryAPI. This function can be used in activities in your application to access the classes.
